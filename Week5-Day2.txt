Week 5 Day 2 HomeWork

1) Finish all prior assignments and submit by PR

2) Finish your group project and submit by Pr

3) Dashboard login project

You will be utilizing netlify idenity provider to create a login. This project should consist of 3 parts.

1) A login screen ( Needs to be built ). On this screen, you will have an idenity provider to login through using netlify identity. ( Should have some branding/logo and the idenity login button ) 

2) A login provider using netlify identity. Choose github to make it easy to start with

3) A dashboard screen to show when you are logged in ( Should already be a html bootstrap page you built )

The flow should be as follows:

When I come to your site, I land on the login screen where I need to login using github. On a successful login, I get redirected to the dashboard page and show that I am logged in. I also am now presented with a logout option on my
dashboard screen.

If all of this is accomplished, work on converting this to an angular application where the login screen uses routes to automatically redirect.

If all of the above is accomplished, please deploy the project using netlify and provide the URL and code in the Pr. ( This will be a tricky step as we have not gone over how to deploy a framework project yet, but should be
something that a tiny bit of research can help overcome )
